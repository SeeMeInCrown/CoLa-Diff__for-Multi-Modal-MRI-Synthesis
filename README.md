# CoLa-Diff
CoLa-Diff is a Diffusion Model (DM) based framework for multi-modal medical image synthesis. The algorithm is elaborated in our paper [CoLa-Diff: Conditional Latent Diffusion Model for Multi-Modal MRI Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14081)
# Overview
CoLa-diff integrates multi-condition from available MRI contrasts in a compact and low-dimensional latent space to guide the generation of missing modality $x\in\mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 1}$.
